<p>Hey there, I'm Mauro Gonçalves, 29, and I've recently decided to change my life and start programming.</p> 
<p></p>For now I've started my studies with HTML and CSS, and after I intend to learn Java and Python.</p>
<p></p>Eventually I intend to find work in Web Development, or another area, but for now I'm still getting to know the programming world.</p>
<p></p>If you want or need to contact me, you can use my e-mail: 

                                                  mgwork013@gmail.com
