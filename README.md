Hey there, I'm Mauro Gonçalves, 29, and I've recently decided to change my life and start programming. 

For now I've started my studies with HTML and CSS, and after I intend to learn Java and Python. 

Eventually I intend to find work in Web Development, or another area, but for now I'm still getting to know the programming world.

If you want or need to contact me, you can use my e-mail:
